  /* padding increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.

margin increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.

border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding. 

the difference between display: inline-block and display: 
block is that, with display: block, a line break happens after the element
